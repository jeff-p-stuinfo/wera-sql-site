## What do you need for this workshop?

-   Computer (Windows/Mac/Linux)
-   DBeaver SQL IDE
-   Copy of the wera-db DuckDB Database file

## Experience

-   We assume you know, generally speaking, what a computer and a database are
-   No prior knowledge of SQL is required

## Before the Workshop Starts

-   Please download and set up your copy of DBeaver Community version, then connect it to the DuckDB database file
-   You can download DBeaver for your own system off of the [DBeaver website](https://dbeaver.io/download/). (Admin access is not required to do the installation)
-   Download the wera-db.duckdb database file
-   Connect DBeaver
    -   Open DBeaver, if there is a prompt for a Windows Defender exclusion to speed things up, that is up to you. Your faithful workshop presenters did not use that option.\
