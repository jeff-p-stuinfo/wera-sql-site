## What is SQL? {.smaller}

-   SQL is a Structured Query Language.
-   You don't need to know where the data is stored on the hard drive, you just need to know which table it's in and how to describe it.
-   It comes in many flavors
    -   DuckDB
    -   PostgreSQL
    -   Microsft SQL Server (Transact-SQL a.k.a. T-SQL)
    -   SQLite
    -   MySQL
    -   Oracle SQL

## SQL Definition (continued)

-   All of these flavors are based off the most recent version of an international standard. This makes it so that the vast majority of what you can do in one language, you can do in every language.
-   We will be focusing on the commonalities between the languages in this workshop.

## SQL Use Cases

-   As a centralized data storage solution

-   As a data source for reports.

-   Compute calculations on data and store for easy and convenient access.

-   Find statistics on your data without external tools.

-   Conduct data exploration to better understand your data.

-   Other Advanced uses (Partitions, Conditional Statements, Running Tetris ... seriously you can. But don't)

## Permissions

-   Permissions are how you are going to want to communicate with your IT.
-   You will need permissions (at minimum) for the server and database you want to access.
-   You can ask for read only permissions. This will mean you can only see the data, but not change it.
-   If you don't know what you need to ask for, try setting up a meeting to describe the outcomes you're looking for and then determine what access you'd need to achieve this.

## SQL Objects {.scrollable .smaller}

-   Server
    -   Contains at least one database and allows for data sequestering.
-   Database
    -   Contains every other object.
-   Schema
    -   Used for organizing tables and restricting access and permissions.

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
-   ***Tables***

    -   Contains the actual data (finally!).

-   ***Views***

    -   Like a Table but can be created on demand for the most recent data and can be made from finalized queries.
:::

-   ... and many more!

## Exercise 1 : Setting up our SQL Environment

-   We will be using the DBeaver IDE
    -   If you can't there is another option.
-   Our SQL server is built and will be run using DuckDB
-   Set up DBeaver and connect it to the DuckDB file

## Steps {.scrollable .smaller}

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 15, seconds = 0, top = 0, bottom = NULL)
```

[If you can't download or use DBeaver, go to the next slide for a different option.]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}

<<<<<<< HEAD
1.  Go to DBeaver Community Download: <https://dbeaver.io/download/>

2.  Download it.

3.  Open it on your computer.

4.  Only install it for your account OR just unzip it. 

    4a. You will need to download the JDBC driver.Please do so.

5.  Now connect to the data by going to <https://github.com/jeff-p-stuinfo/wera_sql_24>

6.  Click on the file labeled "wera-db.duckdb" and download it.

7.  Open DBeaver.

8.  In the upper left corner, click on the blue plug with the green plus side. ![](assets/images/dbeaver_step8.png)

9.  In the popup that appears, type in "duck", and click on the only option. Then click "next"\
    ![](assets/images/dbeaver_step9.png)

10. Click on "Open" and navigate to where you downloaded "wera-db.duckdb" and select that file. Then click Finish.

## Steps For Shell {.smaller .scrollable}

## SELECT Statements {.smaller}

-   SELECT Statements tell the query which column you want in your output.
-   You can either select some columns by naming them or all of them by using the '\*' character.
-   You can specify DISTINCT to give unique results from your query

Note[^1]

[^1]: Note that you can write `SELECT` or `select` or even `sElEcT` (please don't). The convention is to use all capital letters for key words.

``` sql
-- by the way, you can leave notes for yourself in the code by 
-- typing two hyphens next to each other.
SELECT *

SELECT SchoolYear,
       graduation

SELECT DISTINCT SchoolYear
```

## FROM Statements {.smaller}

-   FROM statements tell the query which table to pull from
-   Your SELECT statement won't run without a FROM statement, but must be written before the FROM statement.

``` sql
/* Here's another way
to leave a 
comment over multiple lines */
 SELECT *
   FROM Table1
   
 SELECT SchoolYear
        ,graduationrate
   FROM graduation
   
 SELECT DISTINCT 
        SchoolYear
   FROM "wera-db".main.graduation
```

::: footer
spaces and new lines don't matter for making the code work. The sql code can all be on one line.
:::

## If you remember nothing else from this section

::: callout-important
Remember that you can get data from a table using a combination of a SELECT statement and a FROM clause.

Don't worry too much about how your code looks. As long as it runs and you can read it later, it's fine. If you want very well organized code that can take some time and effort. Jeff recommends giving it to Cameron to write.

## WHERE Statements {.smaller .scrollable}

-   WHERE statements tell the query what filter conditions you want. WHERE clauses always come after the FROM Clause.

    -   Number columns can be filtered with comparison operators =, \>, \<, !=

    ``` sql
    SELECT *
      FROM "wera-db".main.graduation AS g -- The AS keyword is an alias. 
                                          -- You can rename something if you 
                                          -- don't want to have to type it 
                                          -- out all the time.
     WHERE g.GraduationRate < 0.1
    ```

    -   Text Columns are based of characters and can also use the =, \>, \<, != operators. They can also use the LIKE keyword.

    ``` sql
    SELECT *
      FROM "wera-db".main.enrollment AS e
     WHERE e.SchoolName LIKE '%Jefferson%'
    ```

-   The '%' character is a wildcard. It means "anything can go where this character is".

## WHERE Statements Part 2

-   You can also use **BETWEEEN** ... **AND** to find something in a range.

``` sql
SELECT *
  FROM "wera-db".main.graduation AS g
 WHERE g.GraduationRate BETWEEN 0.1 AND 0.5
```

-   You can also use the **AND** keyword to use more than one filter. (and you can use more than one **AND**)

``` sql
SELECT *
  FROM "wera-db".main.graduation AS g
 WHERE g.GraduationRate BETWEEN 0.1 AND 0.5
   AND g.StudentGroupType = 'All'
```

## WHERE Statements Part 3
<<<<<<< HEAD

-   You can filter on whether something is **NULL**.
    -   A **NULL** value says that there is no data present.
-   Filter by saying WHERE column IS NULL

``` sql
=======
-   You can filter on whether something is **NULL**.
    -   A **NULL** value says that there is no data present. 
-   Filter by saying WHERE column IS NULL
```{.sql}
>>>>>>> fed0472177510ac2b73489add319bd3b9d3b379d
SELECT DistrictName
FROM main.enrollment
WHERE SchoolName IS NULL
```

## If you remember nothing else from this section

::: callout-important
Remember that WHERE clauses FILTER data.
:::

## ORDER BY {.scrollable .smaller}

-   Comes after where clause.
-   Sorts the data.
-   Can be either **ASC**ending or **DESC**ending.
-   Example

``` sql
-- Most ways
  SELECT DISTINCT *
    FROM "wera-db".main.enrollment AS e
   WHERE e.SchoolName LIKE '%Jefferson%'
ORDER BY DistrictName DESC
```

## Inline Functions {.smaller}

-   In line functions can be used in the SELECT statement
-   Aggregation functions allow you to do one action to many rows at the same time.
-   These are some of the common ones
    -   SUM (adds together numbers of a numeric column over a set of grouped rows)
    -   COUNT (counts the number of non-blank cells in a column over a set of grouped rows)
    -   MIN (finds the smallest number of a numeric column over a set of grouped rows)
    -   MAX (finds the largest number of a numeric column over a set of grouped rows)
    -   AVG (finds the average of a numeric column over a set of grouped rows)
    -   LEFT/RIGHT (extracts the left or right characters from text)
-   Using one of these functions will require you to use an alias to rename the column.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## COUNT

-   You can Count a specific column. This will count all non-NULL values in that column.
-   You can Count *everything* with COUNT(\*)

``` sql
=======
## COUNT 
-   You can Count a specific column. This will count all non-NULL values in that column.
-   You can Count *everything* with COUNT(*)

```{.sql}

SELECT COUNT(*) as record_count --This will get all of the records in the table
FROM main.enrollment
```

## GROUP BY

-   Allows for aggregation
<<<<<<< HEAD
-   You will need each column that is not aggregated to be in the group by statement.

``` sql

## JOINs {.smaller .scrollable}

-   JOINs allow you to output data from multiple tables at the same time.
-   For the purposes of this workshop, we will focus on LEFT JOINs and INNER JOINs. There are also RIGHT JOINs and FULL OUTER JOINs.

LEFT JOIN                                                                         INNER JOIN

<<<<<<< HEAD

>>>>>>> fed0472177510ac2b73489add319bd3b9d3b379d

## Join Sytax

-   Comes between FROM Clause and WHERE clause.
-   Think of it as a way to expand what you're querying from.
-   You need at least one column from each table to match **ON**.

``` sql
SELECT *
  FROM table1
       LEFT JOIN table2 
              ON table1.SchoolName = table2.SchoolName
```

## LEFT vs INNER {.smaller .incremental}
<<<<<<< HEAD

-   ***THESE SHOULD BE INCREMENTAL, BUT IT'S NOT WORKING!***
-   Use a LEFT JOIN when you want one of your tables to be a "base".
-   That way, you can get all the information you know you want in your base table and then just add details.
-   Use an INNER JOIN when you want only those rows that are common to both.
-   For instance, if you did an INNER JOIN on enrollment and graduation, you would only have the data for schools with enrollment **AND** graduation data.

## Exercise 5 (Part 1)

countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0, top = 0, bottom = NULL)
```

1.  Using your answer to 4.2 as a reference (you can use ours if you didn't finish), join in to the public directory, find the administrator.

``` sql
-- Example Syntax from 4.2

  SELECT DistrictName, COUNT(*) as BigSchoolCount
    FROM "wera-db".main.enrollment
   WHERE student_count > 1000 
     AND OrganizationLevel = 'School' 
     AND student_group = 'All Students' 
     AND GradeLevel = 'All Grades'
GROUP BY DistrictName 
ORDER BY BigSchoolCount DESC;
```

## Exercise 5 (Part 2)

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0, top = 0, bottom = NULL)
```

1.  Using your answer to 4.2 as a reference (you can use ours if you didn't finish), join in to the public directory, find the administrator.
2.  Using your code from question 1, also find the top five schools by graduation rate that have an enrollment greater than 1000. Be sure to include the school year.

## Exercise 5 (Part 3)

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0, top = 0, bottom = NULL)
```

1.  Using your answer to 4.2 as a reference (you can use ours if you didn't finish), join in to the public directory, find the administrator.
2.  Using your code from question 1, also find the top five schools by graduation rate that have an enrollment greater than 1000. Be sure to include the school year.
3.  Find schools that have enrollment but no graduation data. (Fun fact! You can't use = to find NULL values. There must be some other way to find out what IS NULL. Hmmm...)
=======
-  ***THESE SHOULD BE INCREMENTAL, BUT IT'S NOT WORKING!***
-   Use a LEFT JOIN when you want one of your tables to be a "base". 
-   That way, you can get all the information you know you want in your base table and then just add details.
-   Use an INNER JOIN when you want only those rows that are common to both. 
-   For instance, if you did an INNER JOIN on enrollment and graduation, you would only have the data for schools with enrollment **AND** graduation data.

## Exercise 5

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 15, seconds = 0, top = 0, bottom = NULL)
```

1.  Using your answer to 4.2 as a reference (or ours if you didn't finish), join in to the public directory, find the administrator.
2.  Find the bottom five schools by graduation rate that have an enrollment greater than 1000. Be sure to include the school year.
3.  Find schools that have enrollment but no graduation data. NEED TO MAKE THIS QUESTION DIFFERENT.

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs) (WITH Keyword) {.smaller}

-   This allows for doing queries off to the side, which is helpful when you want to do multiple things at once.
-   Goes before the SELECT statement.
-   Example (you can't call an aggregate function inside of an aggregate function)

``` {.sql code-line-numbers="|1-9|10-11"}
WITH step1 AS (
SELECT SchoolYear, 
       SUM(graduate)/SUM(finalcohort) AS grad_rate,
       SUM(continuing)/SUM(finalcohort) AS continuing_rate
  FROM "wera-db".main.graduation
  WHERE studentgrouptype = 'All'
    AND cohort = 'Four Year'
    AND organizationlevel = 'State'
GROUP BY SchoolYear)
SELECT SUM(grad_rate + continuing_rate) AS combined_rate
  FROM step1

## Advanced topics {.smaller .scrollable}

#### HAVING

-   Similar to WHERE statements, but they are used if you are filtering based off an aggregate function.

-   Comes after the GROUP BY clause and before the ORDER BY clause.

-   If you need to filter on a row-level criteria, use the WHERE clause.

-   Example

``` sql

SELECT COUNT(*) as DistrictCount
  FROM "wera-db".main.enrollment
 WHERE student_count BETWEEN 900 AND 1100
   AND OrganizationLevel = 'District'
   AND student_group = 'All Students'
   AND GradeLevel = 'All Grades'
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

#### Which Order do these go in?

The list below contains *all* the possible keywords. We will get to all of them in this workshop.

``` sql

  WITH cte_name AS ()
  SELECT DISTINCT
         column
         ,AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression), …
    FROM mytable
         JOIN another_table
           ON mytable.column = another_table.column
   WHERE constraint_expression
GROUP BY column
  HAVING constraint_expression
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
   LIMIT count;
```

#### Limit the number of results {.scrollable .smaller}

::: {.scrollable .smaller}
-   This is one of those areas where SQL languages will differ.

-   Most languages will say "Put the LIMIT keyword after everything else and put the number of rows you want.

-   Microsoft SQL Products will have you put the TOP keyword after the SELECT Statement.

-   Examples:

``` sql

-- Most ways

SELECT DISTINCT *
  FROM "wera-db".main.enrollment AS e
 WHERE e.SchoolName LIKE '%Jefferson%'
 LIMIT 10

-- Microsoft way

SELECT DISTINCT TOP 10 *
  FROM [wera-db].main.enrollment AS e
 WHERE e.SchoolName LIKE '%Jefferson%'
```
